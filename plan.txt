 🚨 Risk Mitigation

 Risk 1: Tailwind releases major update
 - Mitigation: Focus on hybrid approach they can't match

 Risk 2: Low initial adoption
 - Mitigation: Aggressive content marketing, free tier generous

 Risk 3: Component quality concerns
 - Mitigation: Hire 2 senior frontend devs for component library

 Risk 4: Documentation gaps
 - Mitigation: Technical writer from Week 8
