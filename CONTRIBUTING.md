## Style Guidelines

### SCSS Guidelines

1. **Use BEM methodology** for class naming:
   ```scss
   .component {}
   .component__element {}
   .component--modifier {}
   ```

2. **Use CSS custom properties** for theming:
   ```scss
   .component {
     color: var(--hikma-text-color-base);
     background: var(--hikma-background-color-base);
   }
   ```

3. **Follow the mobile-first approach**:
   ```scss
   .component {
     // Mobile styles first
     width: 100%;
     
     // Then larger screens
     @include media-up(md) {
       width: auto;
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Use consistent spacing** with our scale:
   ```scss
   .component {
     margin: var(--hikma-spacing-md);
     padding: var(--hikma-spacing-sm);
   }
   ```

### JavaScript Guidelines

1. **Use vanilla JavaScript** (no frameworks)
2. **Follow ES6+ standards**
3. **Use consistent naming conventions**:
   ```javascript
   // Classes: PascalCase
   class ComponentName {}
   
   // Functions: camelCase
   function handleClick() {}
   
   // Constants: UPPER_CASE
   const DEFAULT_OPTIONS = {};
   ```

4. **Add JSDoc comments** for functions:
   ```javascript
   /**
    * Adjusts text color for better contrast
    * @param {string} backgroundColor - The background color
    * @param {string} textColor - The original text color
    * @returns {string} The adjusted text color
    */
   function adjustTextColor(backgroundColor, textColor) {}
   ```

### Documentation Guidelines

1. **Use clear, concise language**
2. **Include code examples** for all features
3. **Follow the existing documentation structure**
4. **Update the table of contents** when adding new sections

## Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that don't affect code meaning (white-space, formatting, etc.)
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

### Examples

```
feat(buttons): add loading state for buttons
fix(cards): resolve border-radius calculation issue
docs(readme): update installation instructions
style(components): improve SCSS formatting
refactor(utilities): optimize spacing utility classes
test(forms): add validation tests
chore(build): update webpack configuration
```
